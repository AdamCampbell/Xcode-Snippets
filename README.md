# Xcode Snippets

Just a few code snippets I have in my Xcode arsenal. In [dotfiles](http://dotfiles.org/) fashion, I thought it'd be cool to put these out in the ether.

## Using Snippets

Just copy the snippets to `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/CodeSnippets/`.

Alternatively, use the [**Install System Plugin** tool](https://github.com/n-b/InstallSystemPlugins) and double-click the codesnippet files.
