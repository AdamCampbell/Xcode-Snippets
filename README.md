# Xcode Snippets

A bunch of Objective-C code snippets [originally by Mattt Thompson](https://github.com/mattt/Xcode-Snippets), converted to `.codesnippet` for easy installation.

## Using Snippets

Just copy the snippets to `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/CodeSnippets/`.

Alternatively, use the [**Install System Plugin** tool](https://github.com/n-b/InstallSystemPlugins) and double-click the codesnippet files.
